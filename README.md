# ML Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains a series of machine learning experiments conducted on real-world datasets. The main goal is to explore different machine learning models, understand their behavior, and learn by implementing them on diverse datasets. Each project showcases a different aspect of model implementation, evaluation, and insight generation.

## List of Experiments
- **Gold Price Prediction**:Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to predict gold prices based on various financial indicators, such as stock indices, oil prices, and currency exchange rates.
- **Diabetes Analysis**: Used Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models to predict the presence of diabetes based on patient data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, and comparison of classification models to determine the best approach for medical diagnosis.
